To whoever comes here looking for my old blog, mostly about Super Robot Taisen, related games or whatever: it's unfortunately not coming back any time soon, and I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.

Why? Well, trying to explain everything would be really long. To sum up: my old Wordpress setup at Digital Ocean got hacked and the email service started to send spam. I took too long to realize the damage was done, so I decided to shut down everything and try to not look back.

In time, I've applied to Google Apps for handling my domain's email, and I'm "migrating" the blog from Wordpress to Jekyll to experiment. Wordpress has its good uses and I really like how easy it was to setup, but some of its drawbacks I faced is that it's really hard to keep it up to date, specially if you use a few plugins that your site is completely dependent on.

Now I'm back to the basics. In combination with Jekyll and Github Pages, I'm really looking forward to keep this blog simple. It'll be mainly about coding in Swift for iOS. I'll maybe ramble about other stuff like games and anime and other nerdy stuff, so I hope you enjoy your stay.
